# Welcome to Page Mosaic!

Page Mosaic is a comprehensive, open-source web platform designed to offer a suite of powerful features for subscription and membership management, email communication, payment processing, and file storage, all hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

This project, built and shared publicly, aims to provide an all-in-one solution for organizations and businesses seeking a robust, scalable, and flexible system to meet their diverse operational needs.

## Current Stage of Development

#### In Active Development: Not Yet Ready for Use
As of now, Page Mosaic is in a critical phase of its development journey. We are actively working on building and refining the platform's features, developing them step by step. This means that ***the system is not yet ready for practical use***.

## A breakdown of the key technical details and their implications

#### AWS Platform for Deployment:

* AWS provides a robust, scalable cloud environment.
* Enables cost-effective scaling, only paying for the resources you use.

#### Heavy Use of AWS Services:

* Lambda Functions: Allows for serverless computing, meaning you can run code without provisioning or managing servers. This is great for handling various backend processes in a cost-effective and scalable way.
* CloudFront Distribution: Utilizes AWS CloudFront for content delivery, enhancing the performance and speed of the system, especially for global access.
* S3 Bucket: Employs Amazon S3 for secure, scalable object storage, useful for storing files, backups, and static content.
* SES (Simple Email Service): Integrates with SES for sending emails, ensuring reliable and scalable email communication.

#### Simple Deployment Process with CDK:

* Utilizes AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) for defining cloud infrastructure in code and provisioning it through AWS CloudFormation.
* The deployment process is simplified, allowing even non-technical users to deploy the entire system via Command Line Interface (CLI). This makes setup and updates more accessible to a wider range of users.

#### Admin Panel Features:

* The system includes a user-friendly Admin Panel for managing both the system's features and certain AWS features.
* Provides functionalities like setting up custom domain names, viewing system logs, and managing other AWS resources directly from the panel.
* This level of integration enhances the usability of the system, making it easier for administrators to manage and monitor the platform without needing deep technical knowledge of AWS.
